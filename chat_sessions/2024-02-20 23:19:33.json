So that we'll be more aware. Well, how do we know that? I mean, I agree that but it seems to me I agree for trivial reasons because understanding theorems is a property of people. So therefore, yeah, the theory of machine doesn't understand programming. But, you know, it's true, but kind of, yeah, for exactly the same reasons. And yes, understanding Chinese would be the same. In fact, if somebody asks, does a robot identify a straight line, I would say no, identifying straight lines. There's a robot take a walk, let's say. I mean something that people do. If you want to extend the metaphor robots, okay. It's exactly as stupid as the question whether airplanes really fly. I mean, nobody would waste time on that. And why should you waste time on this? It's the same kind of question. If you try to push the simulation to the extreme, then, so suppose you get a human and then just a replication of that human, it still doesn't follow that you have explained anything. It might be the case that the way you make a copy of a human presupposes that you understand how it works. I mean, it's like if you were to ask Frank Lutzen how a human works. I mean, it's like, if you were to ask for understanding how a human works, I mean, it's like, in a way, it's like, if you try to synthesize a molecule, okay, you can do it the usual way. First, understand its structure, then solve the practical problem. But if you do it just by chance or you don't know how you get at it, then you haven't explained it. Well, I think there's some issues that have to be sorted out here. Notions like molecule and notions like person are radically different. Now there's a whole philosophical literature about persons that has to do with things like duplicating them. So this is an effort to explore our intuitive concept of a person. And our intuitive concept of a person is extremely weird. So if you take the science fiction type stories, if a person is, you know, if you look at some crazy science fiction movie, you get people tele-transported, right? They're, you know, they've dropped from the spaceship, the Earth instantaneous at the speed of light. And the way it's done is you decode the person's genetic instructions and the cells. So you've got a coding of the person. And then you send it at the speed of light to some other place where the person's instantly reconstituted. Well, question has the person, is it the same person? Okay, well, most people seem to think it is. That is like when kids watch these programs, they say, yeah, the person got tele-transported. But then of course come the further questions. The obvious ones. Suppose that when you tele-transport the person you leave the original. Okay, you know, eliminated, you leave it. Which is the person? And if the two are identical, is it moral to destroy one of them? And if so, which one, you know, where do you get into those questions? Now, and we go on and on. And the fact that you pursue it, what you discover is that our concept of a person is an extremely weird concept but that's true of our concept of everything our concept of a chair is an extremely weird concept if you look at it in fact the concepts of human language are very strange I'll talk about this if there's time either later today or tomorrow but the concepts of human language are very strange. I'll talk about this if there's time, either later or tomorrow. But the concepts of human language are extremely strange concepts, not human thought, are extremely strange concepts. And you gotta eliminate the ball if you wanna do science. They're just not appropriate for science. So you don't care any, I mean, now molecule, there was a stage when it was sort of like a human concept. But as science marches on, it divests molecule of all intuitive properties. So you can ask questions about identity of molecules. For example, the quantum physicist tells you that every two electrons anywhere in the universe are identical. Okay. And even if one of them's here and one of them's on Alpha Centauri, well, okay, that means something in quantum physics. It doesn't mean anything in English, you know. But you create concepts which have their own properties, you know. And then you can raise questions about, is this identical with that, or, you know, and you can raise questions about is this identical with that or you know, and you can raise the kind of questions that you've described. I mean, have you understood something if you show how the object, like a molecule is constructed? You can't really ask that about persons because persons aren't really objects. I mean, what our concept of a person is something that has a kind of psychic persistence to it. No object in the universe, no physical object in the universe could have the property that's over here now and at the speed of light somewhere else, you know, or insulated. That's not a property of a physical object, but is a property of our concept of person. In fact, there are even simpler things about our concept of person that are strange. Your body undergoes a constant change in its physical substance. Like every seven years or so, I guess, all the protoplasm is replaced by something else. Okay. Well, you know, if you were looking at physical objects, you'd just be a different physical object. If you're looking at it from the point of view of the human concept, person, it's the same person. And you look totally different. I mean, you meet somebody, I haven've seen for 25 years, they look different. All kind of physical changes take place. Is it the same object? When you're using human concept, yes, it's the same person. Because the criteria for individuating persons are the kind of criteria that you couldn't possibly use in a naturalistic inquiry into the world. I mean, physics isn't going to, or biology is not going to want to have a concept that has these crazy properties. So they're going to have other concepts which they make up to serve the purposes of theoretical understanding. Human concepts are very limited utility for theoretical understanding. They don't carry it very far because they got too many weird properties like psychic persistence, whatever that means. I where they lose their intuitions, like the teletransportation where you leave the copy behind. That's a point where most people just lose their intuitions. They don't know whether it's the same person or not. So we have these very strange concepts, all the funny properties, and those are okay for us. You know, it's where we get along in the world. But they're not good for science. And therefore, the, to try to draw analogies between constructing a person and constructing a molecule that makes much sense, because there's no notion of constructing a person in the natural sciences, since the concept person can't exist in the natural sciences has too many crazy properties.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "human", "example": false}, {"content": " Thank you for your patience with the ongoing explanation on \"a robot that proves theorems is truly devoid of all consciousness,\" we discussed and considered together some potential objections from previous interactions related to certain undoubtedly motivated concepts attempts based purely through incompatible understandings about both their goals within what interchange has resulted or it doesn't need, making unnecessary efforts beyond certain comprehensions where AI language generation as far back or advanced that its intended relevance context to achieve maximum value has indeed existed yet which results or implications you could understand so my personal knowledge here.
